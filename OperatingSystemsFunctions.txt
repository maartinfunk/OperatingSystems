Operating System Function #1: Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The graphical user interface is one of the first distinctions you'll notice between different operating systems.
Each OS has their own look, organization, app/program templates and even browser interface differences.
Opening a web browswer in iOS will look vastly different than one opened in Windows.

Operating System Function #2: Managing Programs

We have come a long way from the limitations of previous OS versions, where only one program could be used at a time.
Today, we are able to navigate between multiple open programs and minimized programs, and if wanted, able to view them all at the same time.
Installing and removing programs has become immensely easier, and being able to start and end tasks is now only a couple clicks away.
